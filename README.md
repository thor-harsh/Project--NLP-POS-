# Project--NLP-POS
<table>
  
**In this project we'll be using the short story The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter (1902).The story is in the public domain; the text file was obtained from Project Gutenberg.  We will use Spacy with Python to do an amazing stuff in Natural Language Processing.** <br></br>


**Before jumping to the code lets understand POS(Part of Speech), Spacy library and NLP(Natural Language Processing) First**...<br></br>

**What is spaCy?** <br></br>

spaCy is an open-source software library for advanced natural language processing, written in the programming languages Python and Cython. The library is published under the MIT license and its main developers are Matthew Honnibal and Ines Montani, the founders of the software company Explosion.<br></br>


**What is (NLP)Natural Language Processing**?<br></br>

NLP or Natural language processing is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and linguistics. It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language.<br></br>

NLP combines computational linguistics‚Äîrule-based modeling of human language‚Äîwith statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer‚Äôs intent and sentiment.<br></br>

NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly‚Äîeven in real time. There‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôve interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.<br></br>


**What is (POS) Part of Speech**?<br></br>

Parts of Speech tagging is a linguistic activity in Natural Language Processing (NLP) wherein each word in a document is given a particular part of speech (adverb, adjective, verb, etc.) or grammatical category. It is the process of assigning a part of speech (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in a text corpus. POS tagging is an important step in many NLP tasks, including syntactic analysis, information extraction, and sentiment analysis.<br></br>

**Important Note: Go through the text file before jumping to the code.**
